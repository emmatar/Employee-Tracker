  ## Usage
Once the the Employee Tracker is initiated, the user will be prompted with a series of commands. The user will encounter commands with two different types of inputs:

- List Input
    - Navigate using the up/down arrows on your keyboard and to choose the option, press the "Enter" key. Ex: Choosing "View all departments" will display any department that is currently established.<br />

- Text Input
    - When asked a question that requires text/input from the user, enter the information as you would any question, with your keyboard! Ex: When wanting to add a new role to your business, choose the "Add a role" command. The questions that follow will look like, "What is the name of the new role?". This quesiton is looking for a text input from the user, and this should only hold one answer.<br />

The application displays a list of options to choose from when initiated. The first three options: View all departments, View all roles, and View all employees are all commands that display information, but however, will not make changest the application's structure. The rest of the options: Add a department, Add a role, Add an employee, Update an employee role, and Delete an employee are all commands that will seek further information from the User (this is where the "text" inputs come into place, with a little flirting from the "list" inputs also!). The user can enter the information they see fit, and once the prompts have all been answered, a message will display confirming the result of the users commands.
